AI&amp;ML DAY-5 TASK 

Decision Trees and Random Forests

 📌 Objective
Learn and implement tree-based machine learning models for *classification* using:
- *Decision Tree Classifier*
- *Random Forest Classifier*

 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Graphviz (optional for advanced visualization)

 📁 Dataset Used
*Heart Disease Dataset*  
This dataset contains medical information of patients and a target label indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

 🔑 Key Columns:
| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| age         | Age of the patient |
| sex         | Gender (1 = male; 0 = female) |
| cp          | Chest pain type (0–3) |
| trestbps    | Resting blood pressure |
| chol        | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) |
| fbs         | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) |
| restecg     | Resting ECG results |
| thalach     | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| exang       | Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) |
| oldpeak     | ST depression induced by exercise |
| slope       | Slope of the ST segment |
| ca          | Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy |
| thal        | Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect) |
| target      | Diagnosis (1 = disease, 0 = no disease) |

 ✅ Tasks Performed
1. *Trained a Decision Tree Classifier* and visualized it.
2. *Controlled overfitting* by setting max_depth.
3. *Trained a Random Forest Classifier* and compared its performance with the decision tree.
4. *Plotted feature importances* using Random Forest.
5. *Evaluated model* using *cross-validation* and *confusion matrix*.

 📊 Results
- *Decision Tree Accuracy*: Around 75–80%
- *Random Forest Accuracy*: Around 85–90%
- *Top Features*: cp, thalach, oldpeak, ca, thal
